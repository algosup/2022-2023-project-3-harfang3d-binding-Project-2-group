lang: python, golang, c++, lua

FABgen only in python 

compiled lang => c, c++, golang

interpreted lang => python, lua

dynamically typed lang => python, lua

static typed lang => c, c++, golang, f#

binding:
know c++
know target language => python, lua...
and it feature set

f# API is also different of other lang

- long term :
    
    a video game has a commercial life of 1  to 3 years 
    
    an industrial project must be maintained between 5 to 30 years 
    
     maintainability, upgradability , interoperability 
    

goals : produce lastest generation HMIs 

provide sovereignty and strategic autonomy, ensure greater responsiveness portability ‚Ä¶
