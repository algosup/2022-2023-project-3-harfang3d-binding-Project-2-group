safety certification (misra) ,  embeddability and custom hardware , power consumption 

—> iso, misra, autosar

maloc instruction (c or c++)

tout doit etre déclarer avant dappeler la fonction 

JPU on monitor (jsp 😢)

- confidential :
    
    control every thinks  , private licence 
    

- long term :
    
    a video game has a commercial life of 1  to 3 years 
    
    an industrial project must be maintained between 5 to 30 years 
    
     maintainability, upgradability , interoperability 
    

goals : produce lastest generation HMIs 

provide sovereignty and strategic autonomy, ensure greater responsiveness portability …

tools for designers 

prototyping and 3D simulations,  creation of 3D sciences & 3d HMIs

tools for 

secure
—> leurs docs git sont open sources 

API and python 

like lua go and f# 

whats append in human brain 

vr headset, wristband, external loudspeaker, video monitoring 

numpy

fast —> c , c++ , javas 2 times —> “slow”

python 35 times to slow

- biding definition in  python
- common part of the program
- au dessus (python ≤ 3.2) de la version 3.2 python
- Cpython limited  ABI so that extension modules it generates can be used by any version  of Cpython > 3.2.
- dinamically typed
- interpreted bytecode
- C API to extend the language with native extension modules
- ABI Py_LIMITED_API macro
- C API to create values and call functions

Fabgen create a minimum of Three functions :

- `check`: Test if an object in the target language holds a copy or reference to a C/C++ object of a specific type.
- `to_c`: Returns a reference to the C/C++ object held by an object in the target language.
- `from_c`: Return an object in the target language holding a copy or reference to a C/C++ object.

import and call functions from a C-style ABI. most of the time this will be the only way to call into a different language 

**1. Create a mapping of elementary types**

**2. Implement a C API wrapping the C/C++ objects**

**3. Better integration with the target language**
