Work domains
Automotive Cluster

Human Factor study for SNCF
Data visualization
Flight Simulation

control and monitor the robot remotely

Wht another 3D engine?

build a 3D engine from scratch

because there's a need for 3D engine in the civil, defence and industry

visualize and manipulate complex data

are games engines suitable for industry ?
3D engine for the industry because of the strong technical requirement

safety certification
embeddapbilty and custom hardware
power consumption

very specific to the automovtive is misra 
what is misra?
misra is a set of rules for embedded software development in the automotive industry to ensure safety and reliability of the software in the car and to ensure that the software is portable across different hardware platforms.

Industy = Sovereignity & confidientiality

game engines with private and insecure license in the long term
Must run on premise 100% offline
The VG industry needs metrics, very hungry for user data
The VG industry is a data mining industry and a surveillance industry (see the recent scandal with the Chinese company that was collecting data from the users of the VG)

Industry = Long term
a video game has commercial life of 1 to 3 years
an industrial project must be maintained between 5 to 30 years
Maintainability, Upgradability; interoperability

Harfang SDK is a tool for developpers, written in c++ He wants other developpers to use it in f#, 

why C++? mainly for performance 

Valeo Augmented Hazard

from 2millions of code lines to 3 thousands of code lines

Why Python ?
Rapid developpement, by non-computer scientists experts
Strong data science

Cluster 3d Valeo

Mainly use for industries

- Automotive Cluster
- Automotive HUD
- Human factor study
- Simulation
- Data visualization
- Teleoperation


Industry = Strong Technical Requirements (Satefy certifications, embeddability and custom hardware and power consumption)
Industry = Sovereignty & Confidentiality (Game engines with private and insecure license in the long term, Must run on premise, 100% offline, the VG industry needs metrics, very hungry for user data)
Industry = Long term (A video game has a commercial life of 1 to 3 years, an industrial project must be maintained between 5 to 30 years, maintainability, upgradability, interoperability)

GOALS:

- 1. Produce latest generation HMIs
- 2. Provide sovereignty and strategic autonomy
- 3. Ensure greater responsivness, portability and interoperability

extern = packages imported

bgfx = graphic abstraction layer

FABgen written as a replacement for SWIG, an other binding generator.
It tries to solve this issue by:

- Using python to implement FABgen and the binding definitions themsleves
- Implementing as much as possible of the features in a common part of the program (gen.py)

As a newer project FABgen also tries to leverage newer APIs whenever possible.

Python and Lua: Dynamically typed.
Go: Statically typed.
C API to extend the language with native extension module.
Minimum of 3 functions:

- check
- to_c
- from_c

- biding definition in  python
- common part of the program
- au dessus (python ‚â§ 3.2) de la version 3.2 python
- Cpython limited  ABI so that extension modules it generates can be used by any version  of Cpython > 3.2.
- dinamically typed
- interpreted bytecode
- C API to extend the language with native extension modules
- ABI Py_LIMITED_API macro
- C API to create values and call functions

Fabgen create a minimum of Three functions :

- `check`: Test if an object in the target language holds a copy or reference to a C/C++ object of a specific type.
- `to_c`: Returns a reference to the C/C++ object held by an object in the target language.
- `from_c`: Return an object in the target language holding a copy or reference to a C/C++ object.

import and call functions from a C-style ABI. most of the time this will be the only way to call into a different language 

**1. Create a mapping of elementary types**

**2. Implement a C API wrapping the C/C++ objects**

**3. Better integration with the target language**
