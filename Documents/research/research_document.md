# Clients : Research notes

## Who is the client

HARFANG®3D builds real-time 3D tools for industry professionals. Its software suite is tailored to developers, designers and engineers aiming to efficiently and seamlessly develop, implement & deploy 3D solutions (HMI, VR/AR, simulation, interactive 3D), regardless of development language or platform constraints.

## His/her field

Their field is to build real-time 3D creation tools. HARFANG®3D is divided into 2 parts, HARFANG®3D Studio mainly used by designers and HARFANG®3D Framework mainly used by developers.

## Competition

HARFANG®3D is in competition with Unity, Unreal Engine and GameMaker Studio. These are the three bigger video game engine in the world.

### Glossary

- FABGen : It's a set of Python scripts to generate C++ binding code to different languages.
- SWIG : It's a software development tool that connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages.
- API : They are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols.
- ABI : An application binary interface (ABI) is an interface between two binary program modules. Often, one of these modules is a library or operating system facility, and the other is a program that is being run by a user.
- Unit Test : It's a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested.
- F# is a functional, imperative, object-oriented programming language for the . NET PLATFORM. F# is developed by Microsoft Research.
- A Human Machine Interface (HMI) is the point of contact between users and machines. These interfaces allow users to control machines, monitor processes and, in some cases, intervene.
- API (Application Programming Interface) is a software interface which makes it possible to "connect" a software or a service to another software or service in order to exchange data and functionalities.
